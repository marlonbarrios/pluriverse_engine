## About the Project

**Bauhaus Time Traveler | Duet in Latent Space** is an application developed by Marlon Barrios Solano, showcasing a blend of concept, programming, generative AI, sound design, and performance. It was brought to life during an artistic and research residency at Lake Studios Berlin in February 2024.


### Composition

The project is an amalgamation of various elements including software development, a real-time text to image gerative AI space for performance as a live app that runs in the browser, a sound space crafted with Musicgen, and a drawing tool. Additionally, users/performer can immerse themselves in the experience by playing the soundtrack created specifically for the app. 

Latent space refers to a conceptual and mathematical space generated by algorithms, particularly those used in machine learning and generative models. This space is characterized by the high-dimensional representation of data where similar data points are mapped closely together, and dissimilar points are further apart. In essence, latent spaces serve as the underlying structure that models use to understand and generate new data instances based on learned patterns, without being explicitly programmed with specific rules for every possible outcome.

The intention to perform actions in latent space, especially with a model, is to perform within an unknown probability space, utilizing the generative capabilities of the model to create art or perform in real-time. This process involves interacting with the model in a way that it generates outputs based on the vast, unseen dimensions of the data it has learned from, yet doing so in a manner that is unpredictable and unique to each performance. The performer, by manipulating inputs (prompts) or guiding the model's generative process, improvises with these outputs, creating an interplay between the expected and the unexpected, the known and the unknown. This act of performing in real-time within latent space becomes a dance (or a drawing) within a probability space.

The notion of Bauhaus artists as embodiments of time travelers captures my imagination, painting them as navigators through speculative futures, escaping persecution, and finding solace in the purity of abstraction and geometry. In my fantasy, these "Bauhaus Time Travelers" move with speed and beauty, their journey a harmonious blend of geometries and fluidity, experimentation, and design. I envision them transcending the constraints of their era, embodying diverse genders, ethnicities, and ages, challenging the prevalent whiteness of the art world. This dream, rich with the potential of what could be, reimagines the Bauhaus legacy as a multidimensional space, vibrant with inclusivity, humor and the boundless exploration of form and function across time.

## Getting Started with LCM Turbo

LCM Turbo allows you to transform the camera input guided by the text text into visuals instantly. Follow these steps to set up and start using the app.

### Prerequisites

Node.js is required to run the application and manage its dependencies.

### Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Get started by cloning the repository to your local system.
