# 45 Decolonial Techno Utopias | Pluriverse Engine

🚀 **[LIVE APP: https://pluriverse-engine.vercel.app/](https://pluriverse-engine.vercel.app/)**

## Project Description

**45 Decolonial Techno Utopias | Pluriverse Engine** is a performative instrument for pluriversal sense-making—a practice of understanding reality through multiple, coexisting ways of knowing that honor diverse cosmologies, knowledge systems, and lived experiences rather than imposing a single, universal truth.

This application is a technological artwork that uses generative artificial intelligence to create 45 unique worlds that celebrate cultural diversity, decolonial thinking, and plural epistemologies.

## Artistic Concept

This application frames generative media within a decolonial ethics that refuses single-world logics, foregrounding pueblos originarios, erased lineages, and queer, diasporic, and border epistemologies. The 45 worlds are not styles but essay-prompts: each image proposes a relation—between memory, technology, land, and care—so that speculation becomes negotiation rather than prediction.

### Artistic Objectives

- **Decolonize technology**: Reject Western universalism in favor of multiple cosmologies
- **Celebrate diversity**: Represent historically marginalized cultures and knowledge systems
- **Ethical speculation**: Imagine futures based on care and social justice
- **Pluriversality**: Honor the coexistence of multiple worlds and realities

## Project Philosophy

### Pluriversality
This project embraces the notion that multiple worlds coexist simultaneously, each with its own logic, cosmology, and way of understanding reality. We reject Western universalism that imposes a single truth.

### Decolonial Ethics
The application centers the knowledge of indigenous peoples, diasporic communities, and border epistemologies that have been historically marginalized by epistemic colonialism.

### Speculation as Negotiation
Instead of predicting fixed futures, the application proposes negotiable futures where technology serves care, memory, and social justice.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Cultural Appropriation**: Each world is built with respect and in collaboration with the represented communities
- **Representation**: Images always end with "honoring pueblos originarios" as a gesture of respect
- **Accessibility**: The application is available in multiple languages to democratize access
- **Open Source**: The code is shared openly to foster collaboration

## License

This project is distributed under a license that respects the rights of indigenous peoples and represented communities. Commercial use requires explicit authorization from the authors.
